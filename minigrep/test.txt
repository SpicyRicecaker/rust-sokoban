Somebody once told me
the world was gonna roll me

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb 
in the shape of an L on her forhead

Yeah the days start coming and they don't stop coming
fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't know what to do for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to say so what's wrong with taking the backstreets
You never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now
You're a rockstar
get the show on
get paid

All that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
